###Study design
The data used for the dataset came from the project" Human Activity Recognition database built 
from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.

Data Set Information:
* Original Dataset
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity
were captured at a constant rate of 50Hz. 

The obtained dataset has been originally randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data
 and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows 
of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter 
into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

The following information was used from the original dataset:
Attribute Information:

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration. 
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.


*Additional operations:
Test and train sets separated originally were combined in one dataset. Only variables containing mean values of physical parameters (accelerations and angular velocity and their Fourier transforms) were used. 
These data were additionally averaged for each subject (30) and each activity (6) i.e over 180 groups.
